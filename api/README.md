# **API** :computer:

## **Description:** :speech_balloon:

An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods and data structures that developers can use to request and exchange information between software components, services, or systems.

APIs serve as intermediaries that enable seamless integration and interaction between diverse software applications. They provide a standardized way for developers to access the functionality or data of another application without needing to understand its internal workings.
